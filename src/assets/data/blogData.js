      "  If you have jumper cables and access to another vehicle with a charged battery, you can jump-start your car battery. Connect the red jumper cable to the positive terminal of the dead battery, then connect the other end of the red cable to the positive terminal of the charged battery. Next, connect the black cable to the negative terminal of the charged battery, then connect the other end of the black cable to a metal surface on your car away from the battery. Start the engine of the charged vehicle and let it run for a few minutes, then start your vehicle.",
